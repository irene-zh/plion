1,Jerry Choi,choi_j.jpg,2019,The Dental School,,FALSE,-,My name is Jerry Choi and I am going on my 12th year lion dancing! I was introduced into the culture as a freshman in high school. I am currently a 4th year Dental student at Penn so I'm just about done with school and extracurriculars altogether. Let's make this last year a bang! Fun fact is that the lions do not have the correct number of teeth as a real lion.

<break>Favorite Show: The Great British Bake Off
<break>Being a lion dancer has made me realize that I must always push the limits of my own passion, discipline, leadership, and physical ability. From hours of practices, road trips, game nights, and competitions with Penn Lions, I have found a driving force, an anchor, and a family at Penn. "

1,Dan Truong,truo_d.jpg,2020,School of Engineering and Applied Science,Computer and Information Sciences,FALSE,-," Coming from San Jose, CA, I've gotten the chance to watch countless lion dancing performances since childhood. In fact, some of my close high school friends have were lion dancers. Seeing that I had the opportunity to try this out myself at Penn was a huge factor that pulled me towards join. And I'm so glad to have done so. <3
<break> Penn Lions, to me, is more than a lion dancing community on campus. They've been a core family for me at Penn that I have gotten to grow alongside, both physically and socially.
<break> My favorite animal? Myself--it's important to love yourself.
<break> At the top of my bucket list is visiting all seven continents, yes, that means including Antarctica. ;) Imagine a lion waddling with penguins in subzero temperatures! :o"

1,Jia Wei Teo,teo_j.jpg,2020,The Wharton School,Economics,FALSE,-,"Jia's a junior in Wharton concentrating in Actuarial Science and Management/Finance TBD. She joined Penn Lions freshman fall and it has been one of the best decisions she made in college - Lions is family. Although she's a Chinese Malaysian, her only interaction with a Chinese Lion before Penn was when she was lucky enough to catch a mandarin orange thrown by one back in Penang! You can typically find her studying in Huntsman/ Steiny-D/ VP/ Lippincott/ Houston/ Williams/ Penn Bookstore... anywhere! Her current goal is to be able to stack more people in troupe. "
1,Lynn Capulong,capu_l.jpg,2019,School of Nursing,,FALSE,-,"Hello! My name is Lynn, and I blew in from the great state o’ Texas. I’m currently a senior in the School of Nursing. I joined Penn Lions on a whim because I thought it would be fun, and that’s still true to this day. It’s crazy to think that my time with them will almost be over! A fun fact about myself is that I have a cat named Sushi, who is super vocal and yells pretty much all of the time. She is my favorite animal and also food. "
1,Kai Lu,lu_k.jpg,2020,College of Arts and Sciences,Politics Philosophy and Economics,FALSE,-,"Hi there. My name is Kai Lu and I'm from Lanzhou (yes the noodle city), China. A fun fact about me is that I know more fun facts about Lanzhou other than we have the beef noodles, so come find out more about my hometown. I joined Penn Lions because I have never had close contact or interaction a lion dance troupe back in China, so I was attracted to the lion during the SAC fair. Now Penn Lions means more than a club to me; it also stands for family with a group of people on whom I can always fall back. Despite my love for lions, my favorite animal is dogs and there are too many reason for adoring them. One day I want to have 1-5 dogs for one of the best kinds of companionship. "

1,Anant Kumar,kuma_a.jpg,2020,School of Engineering and Applied Science,Computer and Information Sciences,FALSE,-,"Hi! I'm from San Ramon, a small town in the suburbs of San Francisco. At Penn, I study computer science and am really interested in the possible ways computers can be used to understand complex biological systems like the brain. Outside of lions, my hobbies include cooking and playing LOL. The reason I am a part of Penn Lions is that it gives me a place to learn about lion dancing and the history and culture surrounding it while also helping me meet a great group of friends."
1,Leechen Zhu,zhu_l.jpg,2021,College of Arts and Sciences,Architecture,FALSE,-,"I'm from Delmar, NY, which is strangely farther from NYC than Philadelphia is. I initially joined Penn Lions because I was looking for a dance troupe, but after realizing it wasn't really dancing in the classical sense, I stayed because making a lion come alive is its own form of amazing. I should say my favorite animal is a lion, but it's actually cats in general. I have an orange tabby who complains loudly all day back home, and he is constantly missed while I'm in Philly. My current fascination is with the structure of different species of oyster mushrooms -- I blame my biomimicry architecture studio. New item on my college bucket list: in a Lions performance, stack someone, switch places with the head, and be stacked in return. "
1,Nina Chung,chun_n.jpg,2022,School of Engineering and Applied Science,Computer and Information Sciences,FALSE,-,"Nina is a freshman from New Jersey studying Computer Science. She joined Penn Lions because she did some lion dancing in high school and wanted to learn more! As a freshman looking for a new home, she loves the community and the fun environment Penn Lions offers. Her favorite animal (after the lion, of course) is the dolphin due to its playful nature and intelligence. She would love to visit Tahiti one day because... it's a magical place."

1,John Wu,wu_j.jpg,2022,College of Arts and Sciences,Undecided,FALSE,-,"I am John, and I am from Vancouver, Canada. I joined Penn Lions not only because I want to learn more about this tradition of Chinese culture, but also be able to share my culture with others through lion dance performances. Thus, Lion Dance to me is an art form that connects me and my culture."
