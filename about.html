        Penn Lions is the University of Pennsylvania’s traditional Chinese lion dance troupe. Founded in 2007, our mission is to learn, teach and perform the traditional art of lion dance in and around the Greater Philadelphia area. </p>

		Troupe History
		Penn Lions was founded in 2007 during Lunar New Year when one of the founding members, Henry Chow, realized that such an integral art and tradition was missing from a campus that had such a large Asian population. The idea first began during CSA’s Lunar New Year celebration when Henry Chow and Alan Hsu put together a makeshift lion dance in two weeks with no previous experience. After researching troupes at other schools, the Penn Lions mission statement was drafted: to learn, demonstrate, and teach the traditional art of lion dance.</p>

		In the following fall, Henry met Winston Ma during the activities fair. With ten years of lion dance experience, Winston became Penn Lions’ first artistic director who taught the members the fundamentals of lion dance. The first class of Penn Lions included Henry Chow (‘10), Derek Ma (‘10), Carlin Yuen (‘10), Philip Hsiao (‘11), Winston Ma (‘11),  Samantha Ni (‘11), and Michael Zhao (‘11). They practiced all over campus, from McClelland South Lounge to ARCH 314 while moving equipment to and from dorm rooms. Penn Lions made its official debut on February 7, 2008 at the Lunar New Year Celebration in Harnwell’s Rooftop Lounge. </p>

		In the spring of 2010, Penn Lions won the Ivy League Champion title at the East Coast Intercollegiate Lion Dance Competition held at Columbia University. In 2012, Penn Lions organized the second annual east coast intercollegiate lions dance competition and hosted seven different troupes. Since then, Penn Lions has continued on to win the 2013 and 2016 East Coast Intercollegiate Lion Dance titles and hosted the 2014 and 2017 competitions. </p>

	  <p style="text-align: left!important;">
		More than ten years after debuting, Penn Lions has fostered dozens of lion dancers and held over 200 performances. Other past performances include performances for Philadelphia’s Mayor Nutter, Delaware Senators, US ambassadors, US Men’s national soccer team, CCTV, NBC, ABC, weddings, GoogleNYC, and numerous nonprofit organizations.
